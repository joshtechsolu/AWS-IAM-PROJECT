# AWS IAM Project ‚Äì Users, Policies, Roles, and CLI Access

## üìå Overview
This project demonstrates setting up and testing **AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)**.  
I created IAM users, groups, policies, and roles, then validated their permissions through the AWS CLI, CloudShell, and an EC2 instance with an attached IAM role.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Steps Followed
1. Created **StudentUser** and added it to the **Developers** group.
2. Attached a custom **S3 read-only policy** to the group, and an additional custom policy for specific bucket permissions where needed.
3. Configured AWS CLI locally with StudentUser‚Äôs credentials using `aws configure --profile student`.
4. Verified StudentUser permissions:
   - `aws s3 ls` ‚úÖ worked
   - `aws s3 mb ...` ‚ùå denied (AccessDenied)
   - `aws ec2 describe-instances` ‚úÖ worked
5. Created an **IAM Role (EC2-S3ReadWriteRole)** and attached it to an EC2 instance.
6. Verified that the EC2 instance could upload files directly to S3 without static keys using `aws s3 cp /etc/hostname s3://studentuser-assignment-bucket/`.
7. Ran CLI commands in **CloudShell** to test identity and permissions (`aws sts get-caller-identity`, `aws s3 ls`).

## ‚ö° Challenges and Solutions
- **ConfigParseError** when running AWS CLI due to malformed `~/.aws/config`. Solution: fixed the INI formatting and ensured profiles are correctly defined.
- **AccessDenied** for bucket creation while testing StudentUser. Solution: Verified policies were intentionally read-only; used IAM Role for EC2 write access instead.
- **Avoid storing long-lived keys on EC2**: used an IAM role attached to the instance to provide temporary credentials.

## üîê Shared Responsibility Model (IAM)
AWS secures the **infrastructure of the cloud** (physical hosts, network, and the IAM service).  
The customer secures **in the cloud**: managing IAM users, groups, roles, permissions, credential rotation, and enforcing least privilege for identities and workloads.

---

## ‚úÖ How to reproduce tests (summary)
1. Configure student profile: `aws configure --profile student`
2. List buckets: `aws s3 ls --profile student`
3. Attempt to create a bucket: `aws s3 mb s3://studentuser-assignment-bucket --profile student` (expected: AccessDenied if read-only)
4. Verify EC2 role write access by running inside EC2: `aws s3 cp /etc/hostname s3://studentuser-assignment-bucket/`
5. Get caller identity: `aws sts get-caller-identity --profile student`
